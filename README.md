### Key Details
1. The project structure section uses code blocks with triple backticks (` ```plaintext `) to display the folder hierarchy clearly.
2. Markdown syntax for bold (`**bold text**`) and headers (`#`) is correct and works in GitHub.
3. Replace `your-username` and `your-repo-name` with your GitHub username and repository name.

Let me know if you need help with additional customizations!
