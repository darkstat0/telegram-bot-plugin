# Aiogram Telegram Bot Template

This repository contains a **starter template for creating Telegram bots** using Python and [aiogram==3](https://docs.aiogram.dev/). It's designed to make the development process faster and more convenient, especially for developers who frequently create Telegram bots.

## Why This Repository?  

I created this template because I develop many Telegram bots, and rewriting the base code from scratch for every new bot is time-consuming. To save time and improve efficiency, I decided to build and share this repository with the community. Now, it's much easier to start a new bot project with a well-structured foundation.

## Features  

- **Aiogram 3 Ready**: Updated to work seamlessly with the latest aiogram version.
- **Clean Code Structure**: Easily understandable and modularized code for better maintainability.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Perfect for developers starting with Telegram bot development.
- **Open Source**: Publicly available for everyone to use, contribute to, and customize.
